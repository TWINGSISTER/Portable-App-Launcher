# Portable-App-Launcher
A simple Autoit program to call a whatnameyouwanto.bat from whatnameyouwanto.exe with parameters passed.

Simply rename GenericLauncher.exe GenericLauncher.bat to what you need.    Then
edit the .bat to set locally the environment variables. Often this is enough to
make an application portable.
